# horiseon-challenge

## Description 

For this project, I had to clean up the code, fix it and gave it more description. For example, changing div element for sections or compiling css with rules on a logical sequence with comments on top to specify what it does. For future programmers, to understand the code. The purpose of it was to give the user a more enjoyable experience on the website. The end goal was to deliver a better functional website with clear coding.
